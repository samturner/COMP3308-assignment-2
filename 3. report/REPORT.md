#COMP3308 Assignment 2 Report

## 1. Aim

The aim of this study was to demonstrate an understanding of Bayesian Networks and inference. The concept of Bayesian Networks are extremely important because they model variables and their relationships over a given domain. As such, they can be used to answer probabilistic queries about a domain. Bayesian Networks are a method for applying Bayes' Theorem to complex problems thus making them simpler to understand.


## 2. Methodology
 A Bayesian Network is a probabilistic graphical model that represents a set of random variables (shown as nodes on the graph), and their probabilistic dependencies (represented as graph edges). Bayesian Networks are directed, acyclic graphs.

*Variable Elimination* is an algorithm used for inference is probabilistic graphical models such as Bayesian Networks. 

*Likelihood Weighting*
